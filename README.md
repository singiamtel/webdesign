# HTML/CSS/JS learning

This are some of the toy projects I made while learning HTML/CSS/JS. None of them are full applications, but they work as proof-of-concept for AJAX queries, CSS media queries, Flexbox, and basic DOM manipulation

The only requirement to execute them is a "modern" browser. Open index.html and you should see each of the projects
